A text-based idle game written in python
> current version: 0.0.1

### What?
> Thingmaking Simulator (ThSi) is a text-based idle game written in python

### Why?
> I was playing egg inc. and I thought to myself "damn i wanna try doing this" so I started this project

### How?
> You type "make", that's 1 thing. You can buy upgrades with things to make even more things from one make.

## What's the difference between main.py and indev.py
> main.py is the release version where everything is (hopefully) polished. indev.py is the development version where things are left unfinished and buggy to be fixed later and eventually release as the next version.
